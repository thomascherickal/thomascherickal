### Hi there 👋


**thomascherickal/thomascherickal** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🔭 I’m currently working on Quantum Computing AI/ML Dynamical Systems. <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning F# and DDD, particularly, how you can build DDD into F# to build more agile software. <br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Python or Julia projects. <br>
🤔 I’m looking for help with my current job situation (none). <br>
💬 Ask me about Python, Julia, Quantum Mechanics, Optimization, and Algorithms. Prefer Python for applications. <br>
📫 How to reach me: thomascherickal@gmail.com <br>
😄 Pronouns: he/him <br>
⚡  Fun fact: I have played the violin since 1998 but still remain at 6th grade level because I never gave it priority (had other serious jobs). <br>
